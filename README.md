# Blockchain Node Security Checker

The Blockchain Node Security Checker is a comprehensive tool designed to identify and report potential security vulnerabilities in blockchain nodes. With the increasing adoption of blockchain technologies, ensuring the security of nodes has become paramount. This tool offers users the ability to scan IP ranges, identify open blockchain node ports, check for exposed RPC interfaces, and receive actionable recommendations.

## Features

- **Node Detection**: Scan IP ranges to identify open blockchain node ports.
- **Node Identification**: Determine the type of blockchain node based on the open port.
- **RPC Interface Check**: Identify exposed RPC interfaces that shouldn't be public.
- **Vulnerability Reporting**: Receive a detailed report on potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
- **Recommendations**: Actionable recommendations for securing the node.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python blockchain_node_security_checker.py
   ```
3. Input the desired IP range and wait for the scan to complete.
4. Review the generated report for insights and recommendations.
